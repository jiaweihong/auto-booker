# Overview

Autobooker is a React web app with a PostgresSQL database that uses Selenium (browser-automation tool) to allows users to pre-schedule and automatically book basketball / volleball courts through the University of Nottingham gym website as soon as they become available. 

Note: The app only worked if you ran it locally as there were integration bugs between Selenium and Heroku, the hosting platform, as such I could not deploy it online. Also, University started during this time meaning that I had no more time to work on the project.

## Features

- A user can use the booking form to prebook their desired activity in advance

- A user can see other pending bookings from other users

- A user can delete their bookings

- A user can see if their booking was succesful or if its failed with a given reason.

- A user can see the statistics of all bookings in the system
